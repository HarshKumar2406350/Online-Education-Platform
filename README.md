# Online Education Platform

## Project Overview
The Online Education Platform is a comprehensive Learning Management System (LMS) designed to create a dynamic and interactive online learning environment. It aims to seamlessly connect students and instructors, providing a robust set of tools necessary for effective course delivery, student engagement, and progress tracking. This platform addresses the growing demand for accessible and efficient online learning solutions by offering a centralized hub for all educational activities.

Core Modules
The platform is structured around five key modules to provide a complete LMS experience:

User Management Module: Handles user registration, authentication, profile management, and role-based access control (Student, Instructor, Admin).

Course Management Module: Enables instructors to create, update, and manage courses, including lessons, quizzes, and assignments. Students can browse, view details, and enroll in courses.

Assignment and Quiz Management Module: Facilitates the creation and submission of assignments and quizzes, incorporating features for automated grading and feedback.

Communication Module: Fosters interaction through integrated forums, direct messaging, and real-time announcements and notifications for important updates.

Reporting and Analytics Module: Generates detailed reports on student progress, course completion, grades, and engagement metrics, offering valuable insights into performance.

Technology Stack
The platform is built with a flexible, REST API-based architecture, offering choices for backend frameworks and a modern frontend.

Frontend
Frameworks: Angular or React

Language: TypeScript

Package Manager: npm or Yarn

Key Libraries/Concepts: HTTP Client, Routing, State Management (e.g., NgRx/Context API), UI Component Libraries (e.g., Angular Material, Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI), JWT handling for authentication.

Backend
The backend is designed to support two primary frameworks:

1. Java (Spring Boot)
Core Framework: Spring Boot

Web Layer: Spring Web (RESTful APIs)

Database Access: Spring Data JPA (ORM, typically with Hibernate)

Security: Spring Security (Authentication, Authorization, Password Hashing)

JSON Processing: Jackson

Validation: Spring Validation API

Logging: SLF4J with Logback/Log4j2

2. .NET (ASP.NET Core)
Core Framework: ASP.NET Core

Web Layer: ASP.NET Core Web API (RESTful APIs)

Database Access: Entity Framework Core (ORM)

Security: ASP.NET Core Identity (Authentication, Authorization, Password Hashing)

JSON Processing: System.Text.Json or Newtonsoft.Json

Validation: Data Annotations, FluentValidation

Logging: Built-in .NET Core Logging

Database
Type: Relational Database

Supported Systems: MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server

Getting Started (Local Development)
To set up and run the Online Education Platform locally, follow these steps:

Prerequisites
Git

Node.js (LTS version) & npm/Yarn

Java Development Kit (JDK 17+) for Spring Boot backend

.NET SDK (latest stable version) for ASP.NET Core backend

A local instance of MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/Online-Education-Platform.git
cd Online-Education-Platform

2. Database Setup
Choose your preferred relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server).

Create a new database for the project (e.g., online_education_db).

Update the database connection properties in your chosen backend's application.properties (Spring Boot) or appsettings.json (ASP.NET Core) file.

The backend will typically handle schema creation/migration on startup via JPA/EF Core.

3. Backend Setup (Choose one: Java Spring Boot or .NET ASP.NET Core)
Option A: Java Spring Boot Backend
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend/java-springboot-backend # (Adjust path if your structure differs)

# Build the project
./mvnw clean install # For Maven
# OR
./gradlew clean build # For Gradle

# Run the application
java -jar target/your-app-name.jar # (Adjust jar name)
# OR
./mvnw spring-boot:run
# OR
./gradlew bootRun

The backend API will typically run on http://localhost:8080.

Option B: .NET ASP.NET Core Backend
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd backend/dotnet-aspnetcore-backend # (Adjust path if your structure differs)

# Restore dependencies
dotnet restore

# Run the application
dotnet run

The backend API will typically run on http://localhost:5000 or http://localhost:5001 (HTTPS).

4. Frontend Setup (Choose one: Angular or React)
Option A: Angular Frontend
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend/angular-app # (Adjust path if your structure differs)

# Install dependencies
npm install # Or yarn install

# Start the development server
ng serve --open

The Angular app will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:4200.

Option B: React Frontend
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd frontend/react-app # (Adjust path if your structure differs)

# Install dependencies
npm install # Or yarn install

# Start the development server
npm start # Or yarn start

The React app will typically open in your browser at http://localhost:3000.
